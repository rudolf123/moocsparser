That said, they are not "computation appreciation" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will.

We have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics, so that they will have an idea of what’s possible when the time comes later in their career to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal. That said, it is not a “computation appreciation” course. Students will spend a considerable amount of time writing programs to implement the concepts covered in the course. Topics covered include plotting, stochastic programs, probability and statistics, random walks, Monte Carlo simulations, modeling data, optimization problems, and clustering. What will I learn? If you successfully complete this course, you will have: Developed some insight into the process of moving from an ambiguous problem statement to a computational formulation of a method for solving the problem, Learned a useful set of algorithmic and problem reduction techniques, Learned how to use simulations to shed light on problems that don’t easily succumb to closed form solutions, Learned how to use computational tools, including simple statistical, machine learning, and plotting tools, to model and understand data.

What makes infrastructure networks vulnerable and how do we manage these risks in the future? How can their reliability and quality-of-service be improved? Will they become accessible for all global citizens, always and everywhere? Will they remain affordable for future generations? Will they exhaust the natural environment? Will established infrastructure systems be disrupted by technological innovations? How about security and privacy?

Instead of paralysis, have courage: Shoot first and ask questions later. Although unwise as public policy, it is a valuable problem-solving philosophy and the theme of this course: how to guess answers without a proof or an exact calculation, in order to develop insight. You will learn this skill by mastering six reasoning tools---dimensional analysis, easy cases, lumping, pictorial reasoning, taking out the big part, and analogy. The applications will include mental calculation, estimating population growth rates, understanding drag without differential equations, singing musical intervals to estimate logarithms, approximating integrals, summing infinite series, and turning differential equations into algebra. Your learning will be supported by regular readings that you discuss with other students, by short tablet videos, by quick problems to help you check your understanding, by weekly homework problems, review and and a final exam. You will work hard, and, by the end of the course, have learned a rough-and-ready approach to using mathematics to understand the world.

Unfortunately for you, lending money is definitely a risky activity: there is no 100% guarantee that you will get all your money back. For example you may expect losses in your portfolio because of the default of your counterpart. Or, in a less extreme situation, the credit quality of your counterpart may deteriorate according to some rating system, so that your loan becomes more and more risky. These are typical situations in which credit risk manifests itself. According to the Basel Agreements, credit risk is one of the three fundamental risks, together with market risk and operational risk, a bank (or another regulated financial institution) has to face when operating on the markets. As the 2008 financial crisis has shown us, a correct understanding of credit risk and the ability to cope with it are fundamental in the world of today. The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to credit risk modeling and hedging. At the end of the course, the students will be able to understand and correctly use the basic tools of credit risk management, both from a theoretical and, most of all, a practical point of view. This will be a quite unconventional course. For every methodology, we will analyze its points of strengths, but we will also stress its points of weakness. We will try to do this in a rigorous way, but also with fun.

In this first module (MCB80.1x) we’ll look at how individual neurons use electricity to transmit information.  We’ll invite you to build up a neuron, piece by piece, using interactive simulations, and we’ll take you on field trips in and around Harvard and Boston, bring you into the lab, and show you how to conduct DIY neuroscience experiments on your own.', 'David Cox; Nadja Oertelt; Winston Yan; ', 'David Cox;  - David Cox is an Assistant Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology and of Computer Science, and is a member of the Center for Brain Science at Harvard University.

The Poetry of Early New England introduces students to the most important poets of the 17th century, including Anne Bradstreet, Michael Wigglesworth and Edward Taylor. Texts range from theological verse dramas to intimate love poems,  from meditations on nature, family and death to reflections on the civic and communal hopes of the New England migrants. Students will be exposed to relevant poetic forms and traditions,  to rare manuscript and printed materials, and they will have opportunities to practice and refine the way they read, and write about, poems. Course materials include video lectures, roundtable and online discussions--but also interactive exercises and interpretive expeditions to key New England sites. Poetry in America surveys nearly 400 years of poetry in America.  Treating individual figures (Poe, Whitman, Dickinson, Frost, Williams, Hughes), major poetic movements (Firesides, Modernist, New York, Confessional, L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E) and probing the many uses of poetry across changing times, the course provides a historical time line for the American poetic tradition while also giving students tools to approach any poetic tradition. Who, and what, are poems for? For poets? Readers? To give vent to the soul? To paint or sculpt with words? Alter consciousness? Raise cultural tone?

At this time, you can only explore this course in a self-paced fashion. Certain features of this course may not be active, but many people enjoy watching the videos and working with the materials. Make sure to check for reruns of this course. This course is the first of a two-course sequence: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python, and Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science. Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. Some of the people taking the two courses will use them as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many it will be their first and last computer science courses. Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are not "computation appreciation" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will. Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python covers the notion of computation, the Python programming language, some simple algorithms, testing and debugging, and informal introduction to algorithmic complexity, and some simple algorithms and data structures. Recommended textbook. The recommended textbook for this course is: Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, Revised and Expanded edition, by John Guttag (MIT Press, 2013).

COURSE OVERVIEW Iran’s nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria’s civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information — these are among the challenges American national security students in 211x will wrestle with this year.  This introduction is based on one of the most popular, and dynamic, courses taught at Harvard''s Kennedy School of Government. In each case, students are cast as a trusted NSC staffer to President Obama, or to another principal in the policy-making process.  Each case requires not only reexamining current U.S. strategy, but also identifying alternative strategies for protecting and advancing national interests. In each of these cases, which include a special two-week segment on the disclosures surrounding NSA surveillance and the trove of WikiLeaks documents of previously-secret American policymaking, participants have to operate in the rough-and-tumble of a government whose deliberations are discombobulated by leaks, reports about internal differences among policymakers, and press analyses. Weekly assignments require strategic thinking: analyzing dynamics of challenges and developing strategies for addressing them.  Students learn to summarize their analyses in a succinct “Strategic Options Memo” that combines careful analysis and strategic imagination, on the one hand, with the necessity to communicate to major constituencies in order to sustain public support, on the other. They also examine how policymaking is affected by constant, public analysis of government deliberations.', 'Graham T. Allison; David Sanger; Derek Reveron; ', 'Graham T. Allison;  - Graham T.

That past can be directly observed through the study of the human fossil record, the materials preserved for archaeological study, and the DNA of living and extinct human populations. This course will provide an overview of human evolutionary history from the present--contemporary human variation in a comparative context--through our last common ancestor with the living great apes, some 5-7 million years in the past. Emphasis will be placed on major evolutionary changes in the development of humans and the methodological approaches used by paleoanthropologists and related investigators to develop that knowledge. The course will begin by asking basic questions about how evolution operates to shape biological variation and what patterns of variation look like in living humans and apes. We will then look at how the human lineage first began to differentiate from apes, the rise and fall of the Australopithecines, the origin and dispersal of the genus Homo, and eventually the radical evolutionary changes associated with the development of agricultural practices in the past 15,000 years. Throughout the course students will be exposed to the primary data, places and theories that shape our understanding of human evolution.

This course will examine architecture through time, beginning with First Societies and extending to the 15th century. Though the course is chronological, it is not intended as a linear narrative, but rather aims to provide a more global view, by focusing on different architectural "moments." The lectures will give students the appropriate grounding for understanding a range of buildings and contexts. The material in the lectures will be supplemented by readings from the textbook A Global History of Architecture. Each lecture analyzes a particular architectural transformation arising from a dynamic cultural situation. How did the introduction of iron in the ninth century BCE impact regional politics and the development of architecture? How did new religious formations, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, produce new architectural understandings? What were the architectural consequences of the changing political landscape in northern Italy in the 14th century? How did rock-cut architecture move across space and time from West Asia to India to Africa? How did the emergence of corn impact the rise of religious and temple construction in Mexico? These are typical questions that the lectures will address. All required readings are available within the courseware, courtesy of Wiley. Print or electronic versions of the A Global History of Architecture, Second Edition and Architecture of First Societies are also available for purchase. The course is aimed for a general audience at the undergraduate level with an interest in history. All lectures will be in English.

Unit processes involved in the two treatment chains will be described as well as the physical, chemical and biological processes involved. There will be an emphasis on water quality and the functionality of each unit process within the treatment chain.  After the course one should be able to recognise the process units, describe their function and make simple design calculations on water treatment  plants (drinking and waste water).  Overall the course will teach the role of treatment technologies in providing adequate water supply and effective sanitation which are essential for human society and the safeguarding of public and environmental health. There is a global trend towards urbanisation with over 50% of humanity currently residing in urban areas. Water is invariably linked to urban functionality, as industrial, domestic and agricultural use. Essential services such as drinking water supply, sanitation and wastewater treatment to protect surface water and groundwater resources need to be present in such environment. The provision of these essential urban water services present real challenges in many parts of the world today. Accessible fresh water resources suitable for drinking water and other ecosystem services is approximated to be 200,000 km3, approximately 0.3% of the total freshwater resources and less than 0.01% of the total water on earth. These accessible freshwater resources are not equally distributed and many countries today are experiencing water scarcity which in turn affects community health and in many places water scarcity is the inhibiting factor for economic growth. This highlights the importance of conserving and protecting the accessible freshwater resources, through the implementation of adequate treatment technologies combined with a robust infrastructure. Through utilising relevant treatment technologies to upgrade water to a quality suitable for subsequent use or discharge with more and more stringent effluent demands, the urban water chain has the possibility to transform to an urban water cycle and improve interactions within the greater hydrological cycle.

Philosophers, scientists, artists, and poets overthrew our understanding of the physical world, of human behavior, of thought and its limits, and of art, creativity, and beauty. Scientific progress improved the way we lived across the world. Yet the last century also brought increased levels of war, tyranny, and genocide. Man pushed boundaries of good and evil, right and wrong, justice and injustice – and people lost faith in values. Now, thinkers and leaders are reconstructing theories of value and creating institutions to embody them.

Stat2.3x is the last in a sequence of three courses that make up Stat2x, the online equivalent of Berkeley''s Stat 2. The focus of Stat2.3x is on statistical inference: how to make valid conclusions based on data from random samples. At the heart of the main problem addressed by the course will be a population (which you can imagine for now as a set of people) connected with which there is a numerical quantity of interest (which you can imagine for now as the average number of MOOCs the people have taken). If you could talk to each member of the population, you could calculate that number exactly. But what if the population is so large that your resources will not stretch to interviewing every member? What if you can only reach a subset of the population?   Stat 2.3x will discuss good ways to select the subset (yes, at random); how to estimate the numerical quantity of interest, based on what you see in your sample; and ways to test hypotheses about numerical or probabilistic aspects of the problem.   The methods that will be covered are among the most commonly used of all statistical techniques. If you have ever read an article that claimed, "The margin of error in such surveys is about three percentage points," or, "Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley have discovered a highly significant link between ...," then you should expect that by the end of Stat 2.3x you will have a pretty good idea of what that means. Examples will range all the way from a little girl''s school science project (seriously – she did a great job and her results were published in a major journal) to rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court.   The fundamental approach of the series was provided in the description of Stat2.1x and appears here again: There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods.

It will give you a unified overview of mechanics that will dramatically increase your problem-solving ability. It is open to any students who meet the prerequisites (see right), but is especially designed for teachers and those who want to improve their existing understanding of mechanics. Newtonian mechanics is the study of how forces change the motion of objects. This course begins with force, and moves on to straight-line motion, momentum, mechanical energy, rotational motion, and angular momentum. Optional units include oscillations, planetary orbits, and a review of multi-concept problems. Why Take Our Course? Our approach to mechanics is a unique one. Through worked examples and online texts we introduce a strategic overview of core concepts in mechanics. This overview couples with a new approach to problem-solving that will help you break down and solve multi-concept problems. By choosing a system of objects, defining their interactions, and deciding on a model to use to describe them, you will come to solve physics problems more easily and more systematically. The road to "easy" goes through "hard." This course is more challenging than a standard high school or introductory college physics offering. We will help you become a more expert problem solver, and that process involves solving a variety of problems, in many different ways, with our new approach. The reward is stronger problem-solving ability that carries over to other areas in physics. Take this course to better organize your mechanics knowledge, to prepare for AP or advanced standing exams, to teach more effectively, or if you enjoy attacking challenging problems! For Teachers If you are a teacher looking to improve your knowledge of mechanics, or to learn new approaches to teach your students, we encourage you to sign up. Our approach has been researched carefully and has proven effectiveness when it comes to preparing students for later courses. Teachers in the United States, and especially in Massachusetts, can receive extra benefit from this course.

Stat2.2x is the second of three five-week courses that make up Stat2x, the online equivalent of Berkeley''s Stat 2. The focus of Stat2.2x is on probability theory: exactly what is a random sample, and how does randomness work? If you buy 10 lottery tickets instead of 1, does your chance of winning go up by a factor of 10? What is the law of averages? How can polls make accurate predictions based on data from small fractions of the population? What should you expect to happen "just by chance"? These are some of the questions we will address in the course. We will start with exact calculations of chances when the experiments are small enough that exact calculations are feasible and interesting. Then we will step back from all the details and try to identify features of large random samples that will help us approximate probabilities that are hard to compute exactly. We will study sums and averages of large random samples, discuss the factors that affect their accuracy, and use the normal approximation for their probability distributions. Be warned: by the end of Stat2.2x you will not want to gamble. Ever. (Unless you''re really good at counting cards, in which case you could try blackjack, but perhaps after taking all these edX courses you''ll find other ways of earning money.) As Stat2.2x is part of a series, the basic prerequisites are the same as those for Stat2.1x: high school arithmetic and good comprehension of English. In addition, you are expected to know the material of Stat2.1x, with particular emphasis on histograms, averages, SDs, and the normal curve.

The course is aimed at students with little or no prior programming experience who have a desire (or at least a need) to understand computational approaches to problem solving. Some of the people taking the course will use it as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many, it will be their first and last computer science course. Since the course will be the only formal computer science course many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, it is not a "computation appreciation" course. It is a challenging and rigorous course in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will. Those who earn a passing grade will get an honor code certificate from MITx. Please see the edX FAQ for more information about certificates. The required textbook for this course is Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python (Spring 2013 edition) by John Guttag. The MIT Press has generously provided free access for MITx students to an online version of the required textbook for the duration of the course.

Way back in 1978, he helped start the Ultracomputer, a high performance parallel computer architecture, many ideas of which can be found in current multi-core computer chips. Through the lens of parallel processing, Larry''s research took a new look at most aspects of computer systems, from algorithms and programming languages down to computer architecture, switching networks, as well as free-space optical interconnection networks. His research focused switched from high to low performance computing, that is, mobile systems and applications. He took a break from MIT to launch the mobile virtualization project at VMware whose code can be found with the Android OS on Verizon phones. He also founded a used marketplace for digital goods. On-line and distance learning has been of interest to Larry since teaching a "pervasive computing" course as part of the Singapore-MIT Alliance where students were sitting in classrooms either in Cambridge or Singapore; the 12 hour time difference was a fun challenge. Larry''s interest in Python is exemplified in his book "Bluetooth For Programmers" which uses Python to explain how to control Bluetooth functionality.; ', '', '');

Certain features of this course may not be active, but we still invite you to explore the available materials. Disabled materials include: the discussion forum and homework. This is a course for those who are interested in the challenge posed by massive and persistent world poverty, and are hopeful that economists might have something useful to say about this challenge. The questions we will take up include: Is extreme poverty a thing of the past? What is economic life like when living under a dollar per day? Are the poor always hungry? How do we make schools work for poor citizens? How do we deal with the disease burden? Is microfinance invaluable or overrated? Without property rights, is life destined to be "nasty, brutish and short"? Should we leave economic development to the market? Should we leave economic development to non-governmental organizations (NGOs)? Does foreign aid help or hinder? Where is the best place to intervene? And many others.

At this time, you can only explore this course in a self-paced fashion. Certain features of this course may not be active, but many people enjoy watching the videos and working with the materials. Make sure to check for reruns of this course. Quantitative Methods in Clinical and Public Health Research is the online adaptation of material from the Harvard School of Public Health''s classes in epidemiology and biostatistics. Principled investigations to monitor and thus improve the health of individuals are firmly based on a sound understanding of modern quantitative methods. This involves the ability to discover patterns and extract knowledge from health data on a sample of individuals and then to infer, with measured uncertainty, the unobserved population characteristics. This course will address this need by covering the principles of biostatistics and epidemiology used for public health and clinical research. These include outcomes measurement, measures of associations between outcomes and their determinants, study design options, bias and confounding, probability and diagnostic tests, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, power and sample size determinations, life tables and survival methods, regression methods (both, linear and logistic), and sample survey techniques. Students will analyze sample data sets to acquire knowledge of appropriate computer software.
