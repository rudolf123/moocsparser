It has contributed to the development of Italian and European science and culture in all areas of knowledge.\nThe main campus, designed by Marcello Piacentini, was opened in 1935. It is situated close to the city centre, and is the largest in Europe - a real city within a city where teaching activities are integrated with libraries and museums as well as comprehensive student services. Faculties and Departments also carry out their activities in decentralized locations in different parts of the city.  There are two other university campuses elsewhere in Lazio.\nSapienza offers a vast array of courses including degree programmes, PhD courses, one to two year professional courses, and Specialization Schools in many disciplines, run by 63 Departments and 11 Faculties.

A perfect score in the class was 90 points.\n\nYou need to have achieved at least 75 points (83.3% of the total possible) to receive a Statement of Accomplishment. You must also have posted in the forums at least five times.\n\nA detailed explanation of how your grade was calculated follows.\n\nIn its grading, Coursera does not provide a simple means for using \u201cAND\u201d statements such as, \"You must have received a total score of at least 83.3% and have posted in the forums at least five times.\" Therefore, the equation I entered into their automated scoring system was,\n\nWhichever is less:\n\n\u201cThe sum of your reading quizzes and forum activities, all divided by 90 and multiplied by 100\u201d\n\nOR\n\n\u201cThe sum of your posts in the forum (up to five) multiplied by 20.\u201d\n\nThe result must have been greater than 83.3.\n\nFor example,\n\n1) If your total score on your reading quizzes and forum activities was 90% and you posted in the forums at least five times (100%), your final score will show as 90% and you will receive a Statement of Accomplishment.\n\n2) If your total score on your reading quizzes and forum activities was 90% but you didn't post in the forums at all (0%), your final score will show as 0% and you will not receive a Statement of Accomplishment.\n\n3) If your total score on your reading quizzes and forum activities was 80% and you posted in the forum at least five times (100%), your final score will show as 80% and you will not receive a Statement of Accomplishment.\n\n4) If your total score on your reading quizzes and forum activities was 80% and you didn't post in the forums at all (0%), your final score will show as 0% and you will not receive a Statement of Accomplishment.\n\nTwo important notes:\n\nFirst, I set up all of the forum activity reporting logs such that the possible answers to each question were always \"Yes\" followed by \"No.\" When I set up the forum activities for Questions 14 and 15, I neglected to uncheck the box that randomizes the answers by default. Thus, when you went to record your forum activities in Week 8, it was possible that \"No\" may have preceded \"Yes,\" which would have been inconsistent with what you were accustomed to in the previous seven weeks. I decided, therefore, to give all of you full credit (3 points each) for these two forum activities.\n\nSecond, I set the minimum number of forum posts required to receive a certificate at five, but in reality it would have been impossible to have achieved 75 of the 90 points possible in the course without having posted in the forum at least seven times. (I am allowing flexibility on two posts.) The explanation is as follows: If a perfect score on all fifteen reading quizzes is assumed (45 points), then a perfect score on ten forum activities (30 points) would still be needed to reach 75 points. Of the fifteen forum activities, there were only three that did not require posting in the forums: Questions 5, 10, and 12. (Posting your answer for the Question 12 forum activity was optional, and the forum activities for Questions 5 and 10 required you to participate in the forum, which technically could have been satisfied by simply voting up or down on posts.)","ace_open_date":null,"home_link":"https://class.coursera.org/globalfoodsystems-001/","certificates_ready":true,"university_logo":null,"signature_track_close_time":null},{"grading_policy_distinction":"","ace_track_price_display":null,"ace_semester_hours":null,"start_year":2014,"duration_string":"6 weeks","id":970622,"start_month":1,"certificate_description":"","eligible_for_ACE":false,"signature_track_regular_price":null,"auth_review_completion_date":null,"signature_track_price":null,"signature_track_registration_open":false,"topic_id":472,"eligible_for_signature_track":false,"signature_track_last_refund_date":null,"status":1,"start_day":13,"instructors":[2656811],"end_of_class_emails_sent":null,"active":true,"eligible_for_certificates":true,"deployed":true,"ace_close_date":null,"name":"001","textbooks":[],"signature_track_open_time":null,"grading_policy_normal":"","ace_open_date":null,"home_link":"https://class.coursera.org/criticalmanagement-001/","certificates_ready":false,"university_logo":null,"signature_track_close_time":null},{"grading_policy_distinction":"The final grade was based on 3 quizzes (25% of the final grade) and a final exam (25% of the final grade).

Beneath the surface of an audience's quest for useful news and information lies an appetite for a memorable and shareable experience. This book will help you to know it when you see it.\"---Clarence Page, blogger, PBS commentator and Pulitzer Prize-winning syndicated columnist for the Chicago Tribune\"Reading Medill on Media Engagement reminded me of the heady writings of Marshall Mcl. uhan and his `hot' and `cold' media.
